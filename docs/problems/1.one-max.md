# One-Max

## The problem to solve

The One-Max problem is a trivial problem often used to introduce the concept
of genetic algorithms. It’s incredibly simple, but it’s great for introducing many
of the critical aspects of a genetic algorithm. The problem boils down to one
question: what is the maximum sum of a bitstring (a string consisting of only
1 s and 0 s) of length N ?
Of course, you know that the maximum sum of a bitstring of length N is N .
However, if you wanted to prove this using a brute-force search, you’d end
up needing to search through 2^N different solutions. As with any search
problem, this isn’t too difficult with relatively small bitstrings. But what
happens if you want to use this technique for bitstrings of length 40 ? You’d
have to search over one trillion possible bitstrings. To avoid this, you’ll create
a genetic algorithm that produces an optimal solution without iterating over
every possible solution in the search space.
